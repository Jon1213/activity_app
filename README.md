The goal of our project is to allow the user to discover creative solutions to boredom. When the user visits the site they can enter the amount of free time they want to fill with suggested activities. They are also able to log in or sign up on the home page. A list of options will then load and they can browse through the suggested activities. The user will be able to ‘favorite' to each activity that they have been provided with and will be able to submit activity ideas to the site if they have signed up and logged in. The user will have a profile page where other users can view their ‘favorite’ activities as well as their submitted activity suggestions. Phase one of the app will be focused on Bay Area activities and phase two will be more specific to the user’s location. In phase two the user should have customized activity recommendations based on their previous ‘favorited’ activities.

Logged users are able to create new activities and rate activities.
Activities have a title(name), a description, and a (minimum) duration time.
Activities and users are delimited to the bay area (phase 1).

Phase 1
- multi hour activities are one activity, user can combine shorter ones on their own if they want
- set fuzziness +/- five minutes depending on the time for each activity for ourselves with a min and a max (use a generalized time frame of what they can do)
- an input of 35 minutes would be given 30 minute activities
- User can create activities
- metatags in the model even if we don’t use them
- Users can have profile pages
- Create two different join tables to show activities they’ve done or shared and the activities they suggest
- We plan to use either the Facebook or Twitter APIs to allow users to share activities

Phase 2
- use geocoordinates to determine the exact time it would take for each user
- combine specific shorter activities
- use more APIs
- behavioral programming
- connect to facebook api and twitter
- save for later / wish list
- privacy settings on user profile

Phase 3
- connections between users
